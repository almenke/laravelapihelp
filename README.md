The new [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) v5.3 some new routing features, and is a great platform to develop your server (Controller and Model) layer for your mobile clients in the pattern of REST API's.  Chances are that if you choose the Laravel PHP framework to develop a new web application you will love it and inevitably want to start using all that backend logic you created as API’s for your mobile platform.  There are a few pieces that I have struggled with in getting up and running with building API’s.  

Because of that, I have been creating a markdown file to capture these little nuggets of understanding.  Believe me, I don’t suggest that I am the authority on Laravel, not even close.  Frameworks are like learning different languages, patterns, and architecture.  You never really are an expert on everything, you only are an expert for a short time on the parts you use.  In order to not try and remember everything, because I can’t, but also to not start from scratch or reinvent the wheel every day, I like to dribble little crumbs so that I can get back to the information that I need. So this time I decided to put my dribble on a public repository.
Without further wasting my time or yours, this information is for anyone interested in developing RESTful API's using Laravel 5.3 at the service layer.  

*Note: I don't claim to be an expert and there are many sophisticated ways of doing this so if you read this and disagree with the way I have figured things out then you probably don't need to be here in the first place.*
